I"]<p>Unsupervised learning is used to analyze unlabeled data. These algorithms discover hidden patterns in the data without the need for human intervention. Clustering, a type of unsupervised learning problem, is especially useful as groups data based on their similarities and differences.
Our aim here is to be able to provide the best clustering.
#Evaluation:
Now why is this even a problem? You see, in supervised learning algorithms, we provide the ground truth values/labels (i.e. actual outputs) with the data to the algorithm. With these we can easily compare our predictions with the provided outputs with various different metrics like MSE, MAE, Cross Entropy Loss, etc. to evaluate our model. That’s not the case with unsupervised learning problems like our clustering algorithm.
But before we jump onto understanding the ways to evaluate clusters, we shall first understand what clustering is.
Clustering:
Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning which is used to split unlabeled data into different groups. Clustering is generally used in Data Analysis to get to know about the different groups that may exist in our dataset.
Some of the most useful clustering techniques include:
Centroids-based Clustering (K-means clustering)
Connectivity-based Clustering (Hierarchical clustering)
Distribution-based Clustering
In this post, we will be using K-means clustering algorithm to get the intuition behind evaluation methods in unsupervised learning. The steps to cluster using K-means are very intuitional so let’s understand its working first.
